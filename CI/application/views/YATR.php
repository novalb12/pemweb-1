<br> YOU ARE THE REASON<br><br>
There goes my heart beating<br>
'Cause you are the reason<br>
I'm losing my sleep<br>
Please come back now<br><br>
There goes my mind racing<br>
And you are the reason<br>
That I'm still breathing<br>
I'm hopeless now<br><br>
I'd climb every mountain<br>
And swim every ocean<br>
Just to be with you<br>
And fix what I've broken<br>
Oh, 'cause I need you to see<br>
That you are the reason<br><br>
There goes my hand shaking<br>
And you are the reason<br>
My heart keeps bleeding<br>
I need you now<br><br>
If I could turn back the clock<br>
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark<br>
I'd spend every hour, of every day<br>
Keeping you safe<br><br>
And I'd climb every mountain<br>
And swim every ocean<br>
Just to be with you<br>
And fix what I've broken<br>
Oh, 'cause I need you to see<br>
That you are the reason, oh<br>
(I don't wanna fight no more)<br>
(I don't wanna hurt no more)<br>
(I don't wanna cry no more)<br>
(Come back, I need you to hold me closer now) <br>
You are the reason, oh<br>
(Just a little closer now)<br> 
(Come a little closer now)<br>
(I need you to hold me tonight)<br><br>
I'd climb every mountain<br>
And swim every ocean<br>
Just to be with you<br>
And fix what I've broken<br>
'Cause I need you to see<br>
That you are the reason<br>
